# Astro Standard Library

This is the collection of all asx scripts which come packages with every astro installation, also called the standard library.
Most of these libraries just extend the base functionality of the language, reusing the code already provided, but some implement
their functionality on a lower level (Python in this case) and then compile the code to the astro format.

This is a list of all current standard libraries each with a short description:

* `Arrays` - Adds different array functions, like `len` or `join`.
